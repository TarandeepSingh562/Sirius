== Installing a development environment

=== Linux

I'm currently using Linux Mint 20.1 ( https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=284 - UI shouldn't matter).

=== Configuring Eclipse

I'm using Eclipse IDE 2020â€‘12 from:
   https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
   
Unpack it in some directory (tools/eclipse for me).
Run eclipse-ins (from UI or shell)

Select "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers" (well other versions should work, as long as they have a good Java support).

Select a java version 11 or more, eg:
    /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
Customize the install directory if you like.
Install, accept licences, etc.
From the installer, click on "Launch"
By default, the workspace is "$HOME>eclipse-workspace"; customize if you like.



Clone Sirius sources from git:

cd ~/eclipse-workspace/
git clone https://github.com/jpragey/Sirius

Import as maven project : "Import" / "Existing Maven projects"; In root directory, select the "eclipse-workspace/Sirius" directory that was created with git clone; the "Open". Check all the pom.xml are checked and "Finish".
A few Maven plugin connectors may be missing (missing asciidoctor is harmless - used to create doc). Click "Finish".

"Mark goal process-asciidoc as ignored in eclipse preferences"

=== Eclipse plugins
From marketplace:
	"ANTLR 4 IDE 0.3.6"

By default the antlr plugin uses antlr 4.4; We need to update it to 9.2. Download it to some permanent directory at:
	https://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar
	Window/Preferences/ANTLR4/Tool, "Add", select antlr-4.9.2-complete.jar , check it + "Apply and close".
	
As source folders, add "./target/generated-sources/antlr4".
